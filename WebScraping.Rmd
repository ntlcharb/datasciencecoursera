Overview of HTML
HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language and it is used mainly for writing web pages.

An HTML page consists of many organized HTML nodes or elements that tell a browser how to render its content.

Each node or element has a start tag and an end tag with the same name and wraps some textual content.

One key feature of HTML is that nodes can be nested within other nodes, organizing into a tree-like structure like the folders in a file system. Below is a basic HTML node structure:

<html> node is the root node,

<html> node has two children: <head> and <body>.

Since the <head> and <body> nodes have the same parent <html> node they are siblings to each other.

Similarly, the <body> node has two child nodes, the <h1> and <p> nodes.

It is important to understand this tree-structure when writing a new HTML page or extracting data from an existing HTML page.

The rvest package is a popular web scraping package for R. After rvest reads an HTML page, you can use the tag names to find the child nodes of the current node.

```{r}
setwd("C:\\Users\\penza\\Documents\\Ed\\IBM Data Analytics with Excel and R\\5 Intro to R Programming")
```

```{r}

library(rvest)
library(httr)

```

First let's warm-up by reading HTML from the following character variable simple_html_text

```{r}
# A simple HTML document in a character variable
simple_html_text <- "
<html>
    <body>
        <p>This is a test html page</p>
    </body>
</html>"
```

Then use the read_html function to create the HTML root node, i.e., the html node by loading the simple_html_text
```{r}
# Create the root html node by reading the simple HTML string
root_node <- read_html(simple_html_text)
root_node
```
You can also check the type of root node
```{r}
class(root_node)
```
Next, let's try to create a HTML node by loading a remote HTML page given a URL

```{r}
ibm_html_node <- read_html("http://www.ibm.com")
ibm_html_node
```

Sometimes you want to download some HTML pages and analyze them offline, you could use download.file to do so:

```{r}
# download the R home page and save it to an HTML file locally called r.html
download.file('https://www.r-project.org', destfile = 'r.html')
```
```{r}
# Create a html_node from the local r.html file
html_node <- read_html('r.html')
html_node
```
Now you know how to read an HTML page from a character variable, a URL, or a local HTML file. Next let's see how to parse and extract data from a specific node(s) starting from the root node

```{r}
simple_html_text <- "
<html>
    <body>
        <p style=\"color:red;\">This is a test html page</p>
    </body>
</html>"

root_node <- read_html(simple_html_text)
root_node
```
Get the <body> node by using its parent node <html>
```{r}
# Get the child <body> node from <html> root_node
body_node <- html_node(root_node, "body")
body_node
```
You can see it has a child node paragraph <p>

Let's get the content of the <p>

```{r}
# Get the child <p> node from its <body> node
p_node <- html_node(body_node, "p")
p_content<-html_text(p_node)
p_content
```
The <p> node also has style attribute with value color:red;, which means we want the browser to render its text using red color. To get an attribute of a node, we can use a function called html_attr("attribute name")

```{r}
# Use the p_node as the first argument to get its attribute
style_attr <- html_attr(p_node, "style")
style_attr
```

```{r}
# Write your code below. Don't forget to press Shift+Enter to execute the cell
url <- 'https://www.r-project.org'
html_node <- read_html('r.html')

# Get the image node using its root node
img_node <- html_node(html_node, "img")
# Get the "src" attribute of img node, representing the image location
img_relative_path <- html_attr(img_node, "src")
img_relative_path

# Paste img_relative_path with 'https://www.r-project.org'
image_path <- paste(url, img_relative_path, sep="")
# Use GET request to get the image
image_response<-GET(image_path)

```
Then use writeBin() function to save the returned bytes into an image file.

```{r}
# Parse the body from the response as bytes
image <- content(image_response, "raw")
# Write the bytes to a png file
writeBin(image, "r.png")
```

Now, from the file list on the left, you should be able to find a saved r.png file.

In HTML, many tabluar data are stored in <table> nodes. Thus, it is very important to be able to extract data from <table> nodes and preferably convert them into R data frames.

Below is a sample HTML page contains a color table showing the supported HTML colors, and we want to load it as a R data frame so we can analyze it using data frame-related operations.

```{r}
table_url <- "https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBM-DA0321EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/datasets/HTMLColorCodes.html"
```

Like other HTML nodes, let's first get the <table> node using html_node function

```{r}
root_node <-read_html(table_url)
table_node <- html_node(root_node, "table")
table_node
```
You can see the table node in a messy HTML format. Fortunately, you dont need to parse it by yourself, rvest provides a handy function called html_table() to convert <table> node into R dataframe

```{r}
# Extract content from table_node and convert the data into a dataframe
color_data_frame <- html_table(table_node)
head(color_data_frame)
```
But you could see the table headers were parsed as the first row, no worries, we could manually fix that

```{r}
names(color_data_frame)
```
```{r}
# Convert the first row as column names
names(color_data_frame) <- as.matrix(color_data_frame[1, ])
# Then remove the first row
data_frame <- color_data_frame[-1, ]

head(data_frame)
names(color_data_frame)
```


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
